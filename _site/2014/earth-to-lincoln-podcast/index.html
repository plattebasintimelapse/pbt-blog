<h2>Podcast Transcript</h2>

<hr />

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>The Platte Basin Timelapse project takes us on a journey that explores the interior of Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. It is an intimate portrait of our watershed that weaves together tales of human interaction with water bodies. This contemporary Louis and Clark expedition is yielding surprising results and offers another uncharted journey west. This time, it is aided with modern photography and technology.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Union Pacific Railroad was being built in the late 1860s. There were photographers sent out here and they photographed the Platte and if you look at some of those photographs and some of the other photography that was done, you’ll see the river is very, very, very, wide. It’s a very broad floodplain. You know, they used to say it’s a mile wide and an inch deep and you know to thin to plow, too thick to drink- that the only stretch of the Platte that really resembles its original stretch is the Big Bend area between Kearney, Grand Island, out to Overton. It’s been our efforts that have been brought to bear on the Platte and have managed it. It’s one of the most managed water systems in the country and almost all the major issues that we’re dealing with, with water, are all taking place in that Platte Basin. So we want to get at those stories and try to give voice to the people who care about those stories from their own perspectives and bring those to a public.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>This expedition takes us to the top of the watershed in snow-covered Rocky Mountains and on down through morphing terrains with ice-covered rivers that melt in warm seasons. All the while, we witness human uses for water- be it for drinking, agriculture, power, or municipalities. One cannot help but appreciate the ambition associated with this project. Spearheaded by Michael Farrell, one of the co-founders of the Platte Basin Timelapse project, a venture that started three years ago to document the changes of the Platte River- this project aims to connect people to their watershed of source of water. Farrell brings over 40 years of experience in public broadcasting and story telling.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>This is a project that was started in partnership with Michael Forsberg, the wildlife and nature photographer, who produced a book a number of years ago called <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/program/great-plains/">Great Plains: America’s Lingering Wild</a></em> and he and I teamed up to bring that book to the public television audience through a two hour documentary that we produced together and in the course of producing that documentary we drove around the Great Plains- up and down the Great Plains a number of times. We spent a lot of time driving around in cars together and we both have a very strong interest in the Platte River and the water and the resources and the natural wildlife and the endangered species that exist along the Platte River, so we were talking about ways that we could express that in a form that would be interesting to a general audience and we came up with the idea that you know, wouldn’t it be really, really cool if we could show people how that river works through time-lapse photography from one end of the basin to the other.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Made possible in part by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and NET Television, along with public and private contributions, the project has placed 41 cameras within the Platte River Basin, each taking a photo every hour of daylight. Production Associate and news editor, Sierra Harris, is responsible for selecting images from nearly a million photographs to create some of the content of the Platte Basin Timelapse project.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Sierra Harris</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Images are a more compelling way to grasp someone’s attention and being able to show the process of the river and species that have habitats in the river or adjacent to the river, visually documenting that really gets people excited I think. It helps getting more people involved and wanting to check back. And if you look at the river one day it can be completely different the next day and having these time-lapse cameras we can document that, so I think using these images to get that story out there is the best way because sometimes science you know, looking at a graph, not many people want to read the units and really take time to understand what that means. When we show it in a video or an image it’s much easier to comprehend.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>In May 1804, Louis and Clark set out in pursuit of President Thomas Jefferson’s vision of finding the most direct and practical water communication across this continent for the purpose of commerce. This was also in conjunction with his goal of declaring U.S. Sovereignty of land occupied by different Native American tribes, more specifically it was to gain a more accurate account of the resources gained from the newly added Louisianan Purchase. Parallel to Jefferson’s goal, the Platte Basin Timelapse project is working to give our community an accurate sense of our water resources, to connect people to their water source.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Sierra Harris</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>The North Platte Basin, the major story being told there is snowmelt and snowpack in the Rockies -the Colorado Rockies- and then how it moves downstream into irrigation, dams and reservoirs and goes through irrigation and diversion canals. The South Platte mostly tells the story of municipal water use and development for Denver- Denver water use is a little bit different because it’s being pumped to the city. Central Platte is a lot of conservation and restoration mostly for the endangered species, such as the pallid sturgeon, piping plover, whooping crane, and the least tern. Then in the Loup Basin, which is the Sandhills of Nebraska, we have several cameras that show how groundwater is interconnected with surface water and how the rain- the rainfall in the Sandhills ends up in the groundwater, which eventually ends up with the Platte River near Columbus, Nebraska.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Although not one of the original goals for the Platte Basin Timelapse project, it is making notable contributions to science and scientific research.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Sierra Harris</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>More and more our images and time-lapses are trying to be used for scientific documentation—</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>-I’ll pick up a little bit on that. We have young woman named Emma Buckley, who’s a graduate student working with a researcher over at the School of Natural Resources at the University, named Craig Allen and they’re looking at system resiliency and Emma has several locations in the Central Platte Valley where she’s taking sound measurements and water quality measurements. The sound measurements are for bat and frog species and the water quality measurements are for things like dissolved nitrogen and oxygen and other kinds of chemicals in the water and all of those are being recorded from the same locations that the time-lapse camera is, and so what she’s doing is taking our time-lapse imagery- the visual photographic imagery and coupling that to the data that she’s recording.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Sierra Harris</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>So for instance, I know she was working on a time-lapse video and graph of the September Colorado flooding and as you see the water rushing through she can show the nitrate levels rise as the water rises because all the runoff from the adjacent crop fields, it gets into the water and the nitrate level goes up and you can correlate that with the time-lapse at the same time.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>This river expedition is providing us with rich stories with the use of photojournalism. It is offering a new lens and a chance to re-tell our American history by documenting the changes in the land and river use within the Platte River Basin.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Go back through Nebraska history and photography and what do you think about? You think about the Solomon Butcher photographs of the sod house frontier up in Custer County when this state was being settles in the 1870s, 80s, and 90s when people were digging up the prairie, planting corn, building sod houses, transforming the prairie from what it was to what it became. Solomon Butcher went around with a glass-plate camera and documented that and every school kid in the country’s probably seen at least one of Solomon Butcher’s photographs and certainly everybody in Nebraska’s seen them. It’s a rich document of how we changed the landscape. What we’re doing is doing something in a digital realm that accomplishes a similar kind of thing, it may not have the same kind of romance because it’s not people standing in front of sod houses holding pitch forks and showing us their furniture, but it’s bearing witness to change on the landscape and I think the longer we can keep this going, the more valuable it’s gonna be. It will help tell the stories that people will understand about how the river’s changed, it will help people understand scientifically what’s happened in those locations over time in a way that you don’t get with satellite imagery, it’s something much more approachable.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>A dynamic project that is continually changing and adapting to modern technology and human uses and needs, Michael Farrell is beginning to see interests build for the Platte Basin Timelapse project.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Mike Forsberg and I were at a water users roundtable here in Lincoln- Senator Carlson, who had sponsored the bill that just got through the legislature on water issues and putting money aside to study water issues and to try to find better pathways going forward to manage water within the state, said to us "I really wished I had known about your project when I was introducing this bill. I wish every member of the legislature would have seen this" and oh by-the-way, and I don’t remember if it was he that asked this, but somebody said, "Do you guys have plans to go into the Republican Valley, because we all know the Republican Valley is now the big hot bed of contention between Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska over water use in that watershed." Well we don’t have any cameras down there yet, but be sure interested in doing that is somebody wanted to help fund it. So, what- and a lot of people at that meeting came up afterwards, you know, "would you present for us? We’d like to have you come and talk to our group. We’d like to use your material," that sort of thing, so we’re seeing an awful lot of interest in this.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Much like the expedition of Louis and Clark, the Platte Basin Timelapse is cultivating partnerships in some unlikely places as the applications for this project are limited only by our imagination.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>Everyone who’s seen what we’re doing or has seen us present about it begins to see an application for their own purposes. We have a camera out at a place called the State Line Gauge where the water from the North Platte leaves Wyoming and comes into Nebraska; it’s part of our agreement with Wyoming. So there’s gauging information that’s collected there then that gives them a number for how much water has been moved from one state to the other. Well, there’s gonna be a million and a million and millions worth of dollars of effort to rebuild that if it flooded out. The state of Wyoming contracted with an engineering firm to do a complex model of the river that they then ran on a tabletop and developed a set of wing dykes or weirs that would fit into the river and it would push the channel back out. We documented all this with two cameras on top of the gauging station out there. Today the man from the engineering company sent me an email saying "I see you’ve got this up on your website, we’d really," as an engineering company, "we’d really like to show the time-lapse of how this is working compared to the video that we made of our model, so we can see how our model actually worked against what really happened." We’ve been able to capture the reality of what they put in place where as he’s got an engineer’s model that they ran, so he wants to see the differences and I think that just kind of the coolest thing in the world because we want this all to be usable by people like that.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>In the 1970s, NASA launched the LANDSAT program to take satellite images of the earth’s landscape. These images are now being used as a way to publicly monitor how we humans are altering our planet.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Michael Farrell</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>What we’re trying to do is create a project where no matter what kind of a stakeholder you are, you’ll find something of interest and you’re position represented in our project. Our position is- we’re not taking a position on what’s good or bad to do or what should or shouldn’t be done in the Platte Basin, we’re looking at the stories that seem to be the critical ones going forward, where the potential for conflict is high, and where the opportunity to create more understanding to reduce that conflict is also high, so that’s sort of in our minds behind why we placed the cameras where we placed them and what kind of stories we’re trying to tell. So, what we’re hoping is that we can engage the public, we can get the public to understand more about who makes the decisions about their water, where it comes from, how it’s used, and how it got that way and to think about what are the issues going forward and what kind of choices are going to be facing us and what’s your position on this, as a voter or as an administrator, as a member of the public.</p></blockquote>

<h5><strong>Ellen Wright</strong>:</h5>

<blockquote><p>In time, we will see the exponential use and importance of this intimate documentation of the Platte River Basin. We’ve been hearing from Michael Farrell, Co-founder of the Platte Basin Timelapse project and Sierra Harris, Production Associate.
