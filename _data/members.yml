  description: A native of the desert southwest, knowledge of the vital role of water came early to Ariana Brocious, who grew up exploring southern Arizona’s scrubby mountains and dry riverbeds. A graduate of the University of Arizona, she started reporting on the environment—and how humans interact with it—in earnest during her years in Western Colorado, where she worked as News Director for KVNF Public Radio and High Country News magazine. She spent her first year and a half in Nebraska as the morning host/reporter for NET Radio, and is now excited to join the PBT team and put her reporting, writing, and radio skills to use telling the stories of the Platte River Basin.
